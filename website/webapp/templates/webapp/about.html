                <h3>What is Medseer objective?</h3>

                <p>Medseer aims to improve the quality of search results and help users avoid misinformation in the
                    health domain, which can be very risky to gather such information from unprofessional and untrusted
                     sources. Medseer focuses primarily on the literature in the health domain which indicates a certain
                    level of quality. Scientific literature from reputable sources like conferences and journal contains
                    rich  information that has undergone proper review to guarantee its content quality. Scientific
                    literature is authored by subject matter experts in their fields which is a good indicator for the
                    knowledge  experience in a particular domain.  Medseer uses these sources at its backend to harvest
                    knowledge with reliable credibility. Currently, Medseer covers literature in the dermatology domain
                    and intends  to expand to other health domains. </p>
